<h1 class="second">THE DAKOTAN LANGUAGES, AND THEIR RELATIONS TO OTHER LANGUAGES.</h1>

<hr class="small" />
<p class="centerbig">BY A. W. WILLIAMSON.</p>
<hr class="small" />

<p>To the ethnologist and to the philologist the Dakotas and
those speaking kindred languages are a very interesting people.
There are four principal Dakota dialects, the Santee, Yankton,
Assinniboin and Titon. The allied languages may be divided
into three groups:</p>

<p>I. a, Winnebago; b, Osage, Kaw, and 2 Quapaw; c, Iowa,
Otoe and Missouri; d, Omaha and Ponka.</p>

<p>II. Mandan.</p>

<p>III. a, Minnetaree (Minitari) or Hidatsa; b, Absauraka, or
Crow.</p>

<p>Pawnee and Aricaree seem also to be somewhat related.</p>

<p>In my father's opinion the Dakota dialects differ about as
much as the Greek dialects did in the time of Homer, and
the Assinniboin is much nearer to the Yankton dialect of which
it is an offshoot than is the Titon. Judging by the vocabularies
to which I have access chiefly in Hayden's "Indian tribes of
the Missouri," I would suppose the first group to differ from
the Dakota about as much as the German from the English,
and to differ among themselves somewhat as Hollandish, Friesian,
and English. The Mandan appears to be separated much
more widely from them than they are from each other. The
Minnetaree and Crow constitute a distinct group diverging from
each other more than the Santee and Titon, the extreme dialects
of the Dakota. They show more resemblance to the
Mandan than to any other one of the class, but diverge very
widely from it. But very few words approximate identity.
About one half of the words in Matthew's Hidatsa dictionary
appear to me to be in part at least composed of material related
to the Dakota, and about five per cent to fairly represent Dakota
words. Many of these show little similarity except as
compared in the light of sound representation.</p>

<p>When first discovered the Dakotas and Assinniboins were
nomads, living almost entirely by hunting and fishing. The
Dakotas, then probably less than ten thousand, are now more
than thirty thousand in number. There are probably about
three thousand Assinniboins. The allied tribes, except the
Crows, when first found lived chiefly by agriculture. They
have during the last hundred years rapidly diminished in numbers,
and do not number over twelve thousand including the
Crows.</p>

<p>All of the Dakotan tribes and some others formerly made
and baked pottery similar to that found in the mounds of the
Ohio valley. The Osages and some others lived in earth
houses, whose ruins are similar to those of the houses of the
mound builders. The Minnetarees, Mandans and Aricarees
still live in houses of the same kind, and make and bake pottery.
Measurements indicate that the crania of the Dakotas
in size of brain and angle decidedly approach the European
form. The cheek bones of the Dakotas are much less prominent
than those of the Chippewas, and those one-fourth Chippewa
and three-fourths white have on an average darker complexions
than those half white and half Dakota. Among the
Minnetarees and Mandans are many persons of light hair, blue
eyes, and tolerably fair complexion, not attributable to an infusion
of Caucasian blood since the time of Columbus.</p>

<p>No people take more pains to speak their language accurately
than the Dakotas. Their social condition is similar to that
of the Arabs, whose language has within historic observation
changed more slowly than any other. The Assinniboins have
been separated from the Dakotas about three centuries,
perhaps a little less, possibly much more. During all this time
they have been entirely separated, associating wholly with
tribes speaking languages entirely different, and yet their dialect
remains almost identical with the Yankton. We are then
encouraged to believe that their language has not changed so
rapidly as to obliterate traces of its origin.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to ascertain them the most important
features characteristic of the Dakotan languages generally
are the following:</p>

<p>I. Three pronominal prefixes to verbs, i, o and wa. I, this,
forms nouns of instrument. O forms nomen actionis, etc.
Some Crow and Minnetaree words seem to indicate that its original
form was a. Wa, meaning some or something, prefixed to
transitive verbs makes them intransitive or general in their application.
Wa is in Min. ma (ba, wa), in Crow, ba. Scantiness
of material prevents me from more than inferring the existence
of these and other prefixes in the other allied languages, from
a few words apparently containing them.</p>

<p>II. A system of verbal prefixes used to form verbs from certain
stems, regularly varied in signification, according to the
prefix used. The Dakota has seven of these prefixes. The
Min. has three of these almost identical in force. I should suppose
that I would, with as much material, find greater similarity
in the other languages, but the only one I have been able to
trace at all generally is Dak yu. This merely converts the
stem into a verb without changing its meaning. Dak y is
nearly always represented in the allied languages so far as I
have observed by r, d, l or n; so that I find it in Min. du (ru,
lu, nu), Iowa, Mandan, and Crow ru, Omaha ra.</p>

<p>III. A reflexive pronoun tawa, Min. tama (tawa, taba), Iowa
tawe, Osage tabe, forming from possessive pronouns double
possessives, related to their primitives somewhat as mine to
my. In some features of structure the Dakotan languages
present an amazing diversity.</p>

<p>According to Powell (Int. to stud. Am. Lang.) a Ponka in
order to say "a man killed a rabbit," would have to say "the
man, he, one, animate, standing, in the nominative case, purposely,
killed, by shooting an arrow, he, the one animate, sitting,
in the objective case." "For the form of the verb to kill
would have to be selected, and the verb changes its form by inflection,
and by incorporated particles, to denote person, number
and gender, as animate or inanimate, as standing, sitting or
lying."</p>

<p>On the other hand the Dakota could not vary the form of the
verb to denote any of these things except number, with reference
to either subject or object. He would probably say:
"Wichasta-wan mastincha-wan kte,"&mdash;"man-a, rabbit-a, kill,"&mdash;in
which each word is about synonymous with its English
equivalent, and case as in English denoted by position. If he
wished to show that the action was done by shooting, he would
probably not vary the form of the verb kill, but would use the
verb kute, meaning shoot whether with arrow or bullet. Except
that the Dak. order corresponds to the Icelandic the only
difference in structure between the Dak. and English expression
is that the Dakota word kte may mean any time, the particular
time being indicated whenever desirable in all cases in Dak. as
mostly in English by auxiliary verbs and adverbs. If the
word man were represented by a pronoun the Dak. would
be still more analytic, since its pronoun would indicate any actor,
male or female, or inanimate, unless it were desirable to distinguish,
in which case the distinction would be made by compounding
the pronoun with a suitable auxiliary word. In this
feature, often given as characteristic of American languages, is
a variation the greatest possible between two languages closely
related. It is also worthy of remark that the Minnetaree, which
I should suppose the most analytic of the group next to the
Dakota, is one of those that least resembles the Dakota in vocabulary.
Some of the features often assigned as peculiarities
of American languages were according to Bopp and Schleicher
features of the I. E. languages in their earlier stages. Of most
other features said to characterize American languages I find
in Dak. but faint traces. The Dak. <i>does have</i> verbs nearly
synonymous with <i>go</i>, <i>walk</i>, <i>eat</i>, <i>drink</i>, <i>strike</i>, <i>etc.</i>
<i>It is well supplied with purely copulative verbs. It has differentiated</i> the various
parts of speech even to the <i>definite</i> and <i>indefinite article</i>.
It is sufficiently supplied with nouns denoting genera and
classes. This is not a feature of recent development. A much
smaller proportion of general than of special names have lost
trace of origin.</p>

<p>The Dak <i>does not</i> have inclusive and exclusive plurals, etc.
It <i>does not</i> have a multiplicity of verb forms to denote mode
and tense, but when necessary does denote them with elegance
and precision, by auxiliary verbs and adverbs, very much as
we do in English. The Dakota is not made up chiefly of very
long words. On the other hand it uses a great many little particles
and connectives to express fine shades of meaning, wonderfully
reminding one of the Greek. It fully agrees with
other American languages in its wonderful facility for forming
derivatives. The I. E. languages in their earlier stages possessed
equal facility.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we know scarcely anything concerning
the structure of American languages aside from the Algonquin
and Iroquois groups, and a very few isolated languages. They
have been classified, in fact, almost entirely by examination of
scanty and not very accurate vocabularies. In investigating
the relations of the Dakotan to other American languages we
are therefore compelled to base our conclusions chiefly on vocabulary.
I once resided a year among the Chippewas, and in
various ways have had much better opportunities of comparing
the Dakota with the Chippewa than with any other American
language. I have not been able to find a word alike in the
two; and but very few words even slightly similar in sound and
sense. In pronouns few languages in any part of the world
are so strikingly contrasted. If I were to attempt an argument
for original affinity between Dakota and Chippewa my argument
would be that so great dissimilarity could not be the result
of accident. Aside from the Cheyenne, an Algonkin
language which has incorporated some Dakotan words, and
the Pawnee group, the similarities east of the Rocky mountains
are surprisingly few, though the Huron, Iroquois and Mobilian
languages do not seem quite so strongly contrasted as the Algonkin.
Among the Eskimo, the tribes of the Pacific Slope,
Mexico, Central and South America, we occasionally find
identical and not infrequently similar words. In some the resemblances
seem remarkable considering the size of the vocabulary.
Closer examination shows however that they are not
of a kind to indicate a special relationship. They are almost
exclusively confined to a few pronominal bases of very wide
diffusion, and the following: 1. ata, tata. 2. papa, each meaning
father; 1. ana, nana; 2. ma, mama, each meaning mother. As
an example I take the base ata, tata. Dakota, ate (dialect ata);
Minnetaree, ate, tata, tatish; Mandan, tata; Omaha, adi, dadi;
Ponka, tade-ha; Aricaree, ate-ah; Pawnee, ate-ish.</p>

<p>Tuscarora ata; Cherokee e-dauda; Eskimo&mdash;Greenland ahtata,
Aleutian ata, California, San Miguel tata; Mexico Aztec teta;
Otomi, ta, te; Yucatan, Cakchequil tata; Central Am. Tarasca
tata; Darien tauta; Eastern Peru, Mossa tata; Western Paraguay,
Villela tata.</p>

<p>Congo Western Africa, tat, tata.</p>

<p>Japan dialect tete; Chinese dialect tia.</p>

<p>Turko Tartar, Turkish ata; Tatar ata, atha; Kunan atta;
Kasanish, Orenburg, Kirgis ata; Samoyedic dialects, Eastern
Russia and Western Siberia ata, atai, atja, tatai; Finno Hungarian,
Lap attje; Hungarian atja.</p>

<p>Caucasus, Kisti dada. Basque (Pyrenees Mountains) aita.</p>

<p>Indo European: Sanskrit ata, tata; Hindustanee dada; Latin,
atta, tatta; Greek atta, tatta; Albanian, Albania, at, atti; Calabria
and Sicily tata; Celtic, Welsh tad; Cornish and Bret tat;
Irish, daid; Gaelic daidein; English (according to Skeats of
Welsh) dad, daddy; Old Slav, tata otici; Moldavian tata; Wallachian
tate; Polish tatus; Bohemian, Servian Croatian otsche;
Lithuanian teta; Preuss thetis; Gothic ata; Old Fries tate; O.
H. G. tato; Old Swed atin; Swed island Runoe dadda.</p>

<p>In fifty-nine of the one hundred and forty-six versions of the
Lord's prayer given by Adelung in the Sclavonic, Lithuanian
and Teutonic families, the word for father is from this base.
Atta is the form used in Ulfillas Gothic version of the fourth
century, the oldest Teutonic relic.</p>

<p>Papa and mama in Dak., as in I. E. languages, occupy a subordinate
position, having about the same scope as in Latin and
Greek. Words apparently related to these are rare in N. A.
languages, but frequent in S. A., African, Malay Polynesian
and Turanian languages. The Semitic aba, etc., is perhaps related.
The base ana, nana (Dak. ina), though not very much
used in I E languages appears to be more widely distributed
than any of the others.</p>

<p>All the Dakota pronouns which show much similarity to
other American forms are representative of Fick's I E bases,
and appear to be widely disseminated. Adelung and Latham
do not however give pronominal forms in as many languages
as they give words for father and mother, and I cannot so well
determine their distribution.</p>

<p>Professor Roehrig, in his able paper on the Dakota, points
out some very interesting analogies to Turanian languages.
Others might be added. These similarities are chiefly in features
common to I. E. and Turanian. On the other hand the
Dakota shows on the surface striking contrasts to Turanian
languages. The numerals are eminently dissimilar. The
Dakota, like I. E. languages, varies both root and suffix in
forming words, and uses both prefixes and suffixes. In Turanian
languages the suffix only is varied, and prefixes are scarcely
at all used.</p>

<p>It seems to me therefor that it is not unscientific to inquire
whether the similarities of the various Dakotan languages to
various European languages, modern and ancient, so often remarked
are or are not accidental. It is very easy to see that
the Dakota resembles the English in vocabulary much more
than it resembles the Chippewa. The similarities of the Dakota
suffixes, pronouns and prepositions to those given by Bopp,
and the general resemblance of Dakotan languages to Sanskrit,
Gothic, etc., in vocabulary, made me certain of relationship before
I ever saw Fick's dictionary. Yet as I turned over his
pages I was amazed at the similarity of the I. E. roots to the
Dak roots. The Slav Teut bases of Fick seem to me most
similar to the Dak. I am certain that neither the Teutonic or
Graeco-Italic dictionaries resemble the Dakota as much as do
the European, Indo. European and Aryan dictionaries. The
I. E. consonants are represented in Dakota, Santee and Titon
dialects, and in Minnetaree in accordance with the following
table. I omit representatives concerning which I am doubtful.
I have too little material on the other languages to justify me
in including them.</p>

<p>Ch as in chin very often occurs in Dak as a euphonic modification
of k. Otherwise it stands chiefly for d, r, l, n of the allied
languages. On the other hand Win and Iowa ch usually
represents Dak, and I E t. R is found in all the allied languages,
and in Winnebago is more frequent than even in Icelandic.
Iowa aspirate th, represents Dak s, and other sibilants.
Hayden does not distinguish the subvocal and aspirate th in
Omaha. From a small list gathered by my father I judge that
the aspirate is probably similar to the Iowa, and that the subvocal
represents Dak and I E dentals. F in Iowa represents
some Dak p's.</p>

<p>There is wonderful regularity in the sound changes in passing
from Santee to Titon Dak, and so far as I can yet discover
great irregularity in passing to the allied languages. Possibly
fuller materials and closer study may reduce the changes to
system.</p>

<p>Dak proper has but five vowels; a and e represent I E a; i,
i; u, u; and o, either u or a. They are weakened as in I E languages,
and suffixes which raise I E vowels raise i and u to a.
The allied languages have a larger number of vowels, the Minnetaree
ten.</p>

<h3>VERB STEMS.</h3>

<p>The reduplication of roots in Dak as in I E is extremely frequent,
in both, as in other languages, developing iteratives
which occasionally become intensives. The reduplication of
Dak words is like Skt of but one syllable, usually but not always
the root.</p>

<p>The suffix a, aya, which formed verb stems of I E roots
usually becomes a, e, i in Dak as in old Eu. languages.</p>

<p>Ya seems to be rarely preserved: I E pak cook, Skt papakaya
parch; Dak papakhya parch; I E agh say, Lat ajo for aghya
say; Dak eya say. The Dak has many relics of the n of suffix
na, which worked its way before the final consonant; I E tag
touch whence I E tang, Lat tango; Dak tan touch. There
seem to be relics of the other methods, which were however
so closely akin to methods of forming nominal stems that they
need not be discussed here.</p>

<p>Schleicher gives two methods of forming secondary verb
stems: by suffix sa forming frequentatives; by suffix ya cause
to be, forming transitive verbs from verbs, adjectives and
nouns. Both are living suffixes extremely frequent and having
the same force in Dak.</p>

<h3>NOMINAL STEMS.</h3>

<p>As in I E a few Dak roots either single or reduplicated form
nomen actionis, etc. This similarity is too widely spread to be
of value. It is far otherwise with suffixes, which are in a majority
of cases usually representative of one or more of Schleicher's
twenty suffixes, and if otherwise at least derived from I E
roots, excepting a few of obscure origin.</p>

<p>1. I E -a formed from roots, adjectives, also appellatives, and
abstracts, of which the Dak. has many relics: I E stag, Teut
stak strike beat; Dak staka beaten, broken; Slav. Teut kak
sound; Dak kaka rattling; I E pu stink, rot; Min pua stinking,
rotten; Eu sap understand; Lat sapa wise; Dak k-sapa wise.</p>

<p>Slav Teut kak cackle, kaka the crow; Pawnee kaka; Man
keka the crow; Eu sara stream flow, sara butter; Min tsara;
Tit Dak sla grease; I E ar join whence our arm; Win and Min
ara, the arm; Slav Teut lap, lamp shine; Dak ampa light; Slav
Teut krup fear; Dak kopa noun fear, a fearful place; adj insecure;
a Scandinavian base naf, nap, our nab, Icel nefi; Swed
nefwa (perhaps i was the original suffix) the hand; Dak nape
the hand; I E kak spring; Lith szaka (pronounced shaka) twig
shoot, etc; Dak shake nails claws; Om shage finger; Min shaki
hand paw.</p>

<p>In Dak as in I E -a usually raises the stem vowel; I E kid
burn; Teut haita hot; Dak kata hot; I E sik dry; Dak saka also
shecha dried; I E lip adhere; Tit Dak lapa sticky adhesive; I E
migh pour out water, Skt megha cloud; Om magha, mangha
cloud sky; Crow makha sky; Dak in makhpiya (maghapiya)
cloud sky, maghazhu rain. The zhu is Dak-zhu, Min-ghu, I E
ghu pour.</p>

<p>2. I E -i formed abstracts and nouns of agency; I E ar go;
Min ari, way, track, trail.</p>

<p>3. I E -u formed adjectives; I E ragh spring, raghu light,
whence lungs; Min dagho, agho; Dak chaghu lungs;<a name="FNanchor_G_8" id="FNanchor_G_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_8" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Eu park
whence parka wrinkle; Dak pako crooked, wrinkled.</p>

<p>4. I E -ya formed nouns, adjectives and participles. The
Dak still retains some adjectives thus formed, and hundreds of
participles rendered by English participles, but used only adverbially,
and it has become an adverbial suffix.</p>

<p>5. I E -wa formed passive participles, adjectives and nouns.
It is in Dak a living passive participial suffix combined with the
like suffix -an, forming wa(h)an. When added directly to the
root it raises the stem vowel as in; Eu ku contain to be
hollow; Lat cava; Dak -ko be hollow, noun ko a hole; kawa
open. After consonants the w becomes p; I E akwa water of
ak; Gothic ahva river; Dak wakpa river.</p>

<p>6. I E -ma, -mana, -man formed adjectives, present participles
and nouns; I E akman stone of ak, A S iman; Dak imni stone.</p>

<p>7. I E -ra, -la formed adjectives and nouns; Eu kira yellow;
Old Slav seru; Crow shira, Min tsidi, tsiri, Man psida, Iowa
thi, Om thi, zi; Win and Dak zi yellow; I E ghu pour; Min
ghu pour; Dak zhu pour, ozhu pour in, in ozhudan, Tit ozhu la
full; Eu wasra spring of was; Icel vara, Lat ver; Win wera
spring; Eu tag cover whence; Welsh and Irish ti house, our
thatch; Win chira house; Man, Min, Om, Dak ti house; Aryan
nira water of ni; Tit Dak nila water; Om and Win ni
water.</p>

<p>Ra, la is also a diminutive suffix in I E languages. It is the
regular diminutive suffix in Win, -ra, in Tit Dak, -la, in Yank
-na, in Santee Dak -dan also -na.</p>

<p>8. I E -an formed past passive participles whence our en in
fallen, etc. It is still the regular passive participial suffix in
Dak either alone or combined with wa. As Dak verb stems
end in a vowel it is preceded by a euphonic h. When added
directly to the root it raises the stem vowel, as in Eu wik
whence Gothic veiha holy; Dak wakan sacred.</p>

<p>9. I have not found infinitive suffix -na in Dak.</p>

<p>10. I E -na was a passive participial suffix, developing also
denominatives. The Dak has perhaps a few relics; I E ku
bring low, kauna low; Dak ku- in kuchedan, also kun low. I
E mi, diminish (mince); Yank and Tit Dak mina knife.</p>

<p>11. I E -ni formed abstracts and nouns of agency. Possibly
it is found in; I E migh pour out water; Dak mini water; and
a few others.</p>

<p>12. Two words containing -nu, are recognized by Schleicher
as I E; I E and Dak su bear; I E sunu son; Dak sun younger
brother. I E and Dak tan extend; I E tanu adj thin, noun
body; Dak tan body.</p>

<p>13. I E -ta (our -d) formed the past passive participle, and
nouns of similar signification, in which uses it is tolerably frequent
in Dak; I E ski collect, arrange; Dak shki plait gather, skita
bound together, tied on; I E pu destroy rot; Min pu rot; Dak po in
pon (=po an) rotten, po -ta used up, worn out; I E sta stand,
stata standing, stopped, brought to a stand; Dak -sdata standing,
stopped, hence also sdata feeble; I E su sew, sut sewed;
Dak suta strong, compare Min ashu a string cord; I E and
Dak wi wind, wrap around, encircle; Dak wita island; wita
bound together, in witaya together.</p>

<p>14. I E -ta formed nouns of agency and future participles.
It is derived by Bopp from I E tar pass-over, whence also Eu
tar, tur pass-over, possess, accomplish, fulfil. The root is extremely
frequent in these uses in the Dakotan languages, and
in Dak at least is much used as a suffix. The last half of the
word Mini-tari is tari, cross over. In Dak, Eu tur is re; represented
as accurately as possible by ton possess, accomplish, fulfil,
have, give birth, and the preposition tan in composition from
equally represents Skt tar, from.<a name="FNanchor_H_9" id="FNanchor_H_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_9" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>As forming nouns of agency it has in Dak lost the r; Eu pa,
whence Eu pana fire; Dak peta fire; I E ak Skt iksh see,
whence our eye; Min aka, ika see; Crow am-aka, Iowa at-aka
see; ishta eye, in all Dakotan languages.</p>

<p>We perhaps have a few relics of tar as a comparative suffix;
I E uk increase whence Old Sax agen our again; Mand age,
Dak ake again, Dak akton more than.</p>

<p>15. I have not recognized -ti in Dak.</p>

<p>16. Dak wetu, etu time, season, may be I E and Dak, -wi encircle,
with -tu, but is more probably related to I E vatas year,
adj. old.</p>

<p>17. I have not recognized -dhi in Dak.</p>

<p>18. I E -ant (our ing) forming active participles necessarily
drops t and prefixes h in Dak, and in this form, han, is used as
active participial suffix with some verbs.</p>

<p>19. As a plural suffix I E -as seems to be presented by the
Mandan plural suffix osh.</p>

<p>20. I E -ka as a primary suffix forms a few nouns and adjectives;
I E ku contain be hollow; Dak root ko the same, koka a
cask, barrel, box, etc; I E and Dak tan extend, stretch; Dak
tanka large (cf Iowa tanra large). I E da bind; Dak daka
bound by obligation, relationship or league, whence their name
Dakota, those bound by league, those making a league, friend,
comrade (-ta for I E tar). As a secondary suffix it is extremely
frequent in Dak as well as I E, forming in both words of
multifarious relations to their primitives. I E kuan, kwan,
kwanka dog; Lith szun (pronounced shun); Dak shunka dog;
Old Slav suka a bitch; Min shuka a dog. Ka is used both in
I E and Dak as a negative suffix. In Sanskrit and several
other I E languages it is used as a diminutive suffix, and forms
one syllable of the various Min diminutive suffixes.</p>

<h3>PREPOSITIONS.</h3>

<p>The Dak is like the I E languages remarkable for its copiousness
in prepositions. In their use or omission the Dak
differs from the English less than does the Anglo Saxon. As
in some of the old I E languages they are either verbal prefixes
or follow their nouns. Nearly all of them seem to be of I E
prepositions mostly compounded. I give examples of the more
obvious similarities.</p>

<p>Sam. together with, in skt. A. S. and Dak.</p>

<p>En in, Greek, Teutonic and Dak.</p>

<p>On, A. S. with dat, for, on account of, of, Dak the same.</p>

<p>A verbal prefix on, Icel, A. S., Dak.</p>

<p>I E ana A. S. an on, Dak an in composition on.</p>

<p>A. S. at our at; Dak ta at necessarily transposed.</p>

<p>Eu da Old Ir du, our to, Germ zu; Min du, during, at that
time; Dak tu to, till etc.</p>

<p>Eu ek over, of I E ak; Min ak over, Dak in ak -an upon, ak
-am beyond over upon, ek -ta at, etc.</p>

<p>Eu api about, around; Min api with.</p>

<p>Eu ambhi about, around, over; Dak am in akam over upon;
A S and Ger um. Swed om same meaning; Dak om with, used
with plural object only.</p>

<p>A S ni negative; Dak ni prefix in nicha none and base of
negative words in shni not combined with reflexive sa.</p>

<h3>PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>The Dak and Algonkin pronouns are amazingly dissimilar;
the Dak and I E are remarkably alike.</p>

<p>1st person sing. inflection, ma, mi, m, in I E and Dakota.
The Dakotan forms are however oftener prefixed than suffixed
eg; Dak root ha have (Teut aih own) yu formative prefix,
3 yuha he has; 2 duha thou hast; 1 mduha I have; Titon 3 yuha,
2 luha, 1 bluha.</p>

<p>1st p stem. The ga of Lat ego A S, ic etc. appears in Iowa,
ka, ke, etc. The chief base of nearly all the Dak languages is
however, ma, mi, corresponding to I E ma, mi; Lat me, mi; Eng
me, etc.</p>

<p>1st dual and Plural stem. I E na, Lat no, Mandan nu; Teut
dual onki, Goth ugki, A S unc, Dak unki and un. The base
wa whence we, has become in Dak wa I, in Omaha wi me, in
Iowa inflection plural wa, us, etc.</p>

<p>2d. I E twa has become in Dak ni (cf Swed ni thou). It is
however in Omaha thi identical in sound with our thee, and da,
di in most allied languages similar to German du. Dak ya pl
yapi you, and our you are probably also of this base. The
Iowa forms the possessive of personal pronouns like the Icelandic
by -i; Icel min my; Iowa min my.</p>

<p>3d person, I, he, she, it, extremely frequent in I E languages,
is the base used in all the Dakotan languages as least partaking
of a demonstrative nature. In Dak it is omitted except
when emphatic.</p>

<p>I E sa reflexive and emphatic; Min she, the same. Contracted
to s it forms I E nominative; in Dak, as sh nominatives
of i (ish), mi, ni and unki, and occurs in composition; in Min it
forms proper names.</p>

<p>I E sa, ta; Teut tha, this, that; Om the, this; Dak ta, to in
many compounds.</p>

<p>I E sawa genitive of sa, ta reflexive possessive for all persons;
Dak tawa the same, also ta. It is in the third person used
alone in Dak, but suffixed to i in Minnetaree. All its forms in
Min, and those of the first and second persons in Dak are
double possessives analogous to mine, thine.</p>

<p>Eu ki, kina, that, this, he, she, it; Dak ki, his, her, its, etc. In
Nom kana those, etc.; sing ka that, the vowel is raised as in
the Greek keinos. For abridgement of stem in singular compare
our ox, pl. oxen, Nortumbrian oxena, and other relics of
stems in na; Teut hina this; Crow hina this.</p>

<p>From kina, hina, originated the Icelandic and Swedish pastpositive
def. article the; likewise Dak kin postpositive def.
article the; ke emphatic pronoun kuns, clf, etc. Of this base
A S stem he, he, she, it; Dak he (pl hena) he, she, it, that.</p>

<p>Slav Teut da this; Dak de (pl dena) this.</p>

<p>I E antara other; Mandan ant that.</p>

<p>I E i demon, pref, this; Dak i.</p>

<p>I E a dem. pref; Min a, o; Dak o.</p>

<p>I E wa pronominal base used in compounds; Dak wa pronominal
prefix some, something. Prefix wo (wa-|-o) forms abstract
nouns and nouns of agency.</p>

<p>I E ka int. and rel. pronoun; Pawnee ka interrogative; Dak
ka interrogative suffix and in compounds; Ger wer; Dak
tu-we who int. and rel; Gk po; Min tape who, tapa or tako
what. I E neuter base ku what; Dak ta-ku what rel. and
int.</p>

<p>I E wika all the whole; Dak wicha them, incorporated objective.
Iowa wi; Dak pi plural suffix seems to be a contraction
of this base.</p>

<p>Analogous to A S, accusative mik of ma-|-ga we have; Dak
accusative michi, in which the k has become ch through the influence
of i; also the accusatives unki-chi, ni-chi, i-chi.</p>

<h3>NUMERALS.</h3>

<p>I have compared the Dakotan numerals with all others accessible
to me, including some of the forms of more than five
hundred dialects. I can find less than half a dozen American
or Turanian sets that resemble any Dakotan set as much as the
English numerals resemble the Hebrew. The similarity of the
Dak to the I E numerals can therefore be accounted for only
as the result of special relationship or of accident. Except as
noted below all changes are in accordance with well sustained
laws.</p>

<p>1, A S an, Lith (w)ena; Dak (w)-an, ind. article wanzhi one,
wancha one, once.</p>

<p>2, I E dwa; Min d(o)pa; Iowa n(o)wa; Dak n(o)m pa cf
A S ta two; Dak ta a pair.</p>

<p>3, I E traya; Iowa tanye; Dak ya -mni [or ya (m) ni?]</p>

<p>4, I E k-atwar; Iowa towa; Dak S topa; Y tom; T tol.</p>

<p>5, I E kankan, kwankwan; Mand kikhun; Dak zaptan?</p>

<p>6, I E kswakswa; Win hakwa; Iowa shagwa; Dak shakpe.</p>

<p>7, A S seowon; Dak shakowin.</p>

<p>8, I E aktu, Gk hokto; Dak Y sh-akdo-ghan; Sant sh-ahdo-ghan.</p>

<p>9, I E nawan; Dak na (pchi) wan-ka.</p>

<p>10, I E dwakan; Lat decem; Dak wikchem-na.</p>

<p>5, I E k = Dak z otherwise sustained but not proved.
Kw = kp = tp = pt, t and k being interchangeable before labials
in Dak.</p>

<p>7, Neither A S seowon nor Dak shakowin are legitimately
deducible from saptan. Perhaps sakan, sakwan was the true
base.</p>

<p>8, Either Gk h or Dak sh may equal I E s. Dak d for I E t
is rare but S. hd, Y. kd is a favorite combination.</p>

<p>9, I cannot explain inserted pchi.</p>

<p>10, In Dak m and n are interchangeable before labials, but m
for I E n is here unsupported.<a name="FNanchor_I_10" id="FNanchor_I_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_10" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> D cannot stand before w in
Dak.</p>

<h3>VOCABULARY.</h3>

<p>The table of sound representation heretofore given serves to
compare the materials of the main body of the Dak with Fick's
I E bases. The results are, however, in many cases ambiguous.
Besides the number of accidental resemblances of the Dakotan
to the I E languages seems, to be much greater than the whole
number of similarities between Dakotan and Algonkin languages.
Dak anapta is identical with I E anapta in sound, closely
similar in meaning. Dak a-na-pta is prep. a = Icel a on, na prefix
converting root to verb, and pta separate; cf I E pat fall, also
open (Lat pateo). I E an-apta is an negative prefix, and apta
participle of ap attain. My father compared Dak chepa fat
with Lat adeps. I have since found Min idip fat almost identical
with Lat stem adipi. I E and Lat d and p are nearly always
d and p in Min; but it is extremely doubtful whether the words
are related. On the other hand there is little apparent similarity
between Eu karpya shoe, and Dak hanpa shoe; but the
Dak word represents the Eu as accurately as possible; similar
forms are found in every Dakotan language, and it seems
scarcely possible to me that the similarity can be accidental.</p>

<p>In giving a few additional examples of similar roots I select
those that are the most obvious, rather than the most certain.
I exclude those not in accordance with sound representation,
and the analogies of such allied Dakotan and I E forms as are
known to me.</p>

<p>Where the Dakotan forms are not used as separate words it
is indicated by a hyphen, before, if used alone as a verb stem,
after if it requires suffixes. Where the root is found primarily
combined with only one suffix or prefix the derivative form is
given. In some cases the Dak root has one of the meanings
given in one combination, another in another.</p>

<p>The Dakota words that most resemble I E forms are those
in daily use, those roots entering into the largest number of
compounds, those most widely distributed in languages more
nearly related.</p>

<p>Excluding words repeated in compounds and those contained
in phrases I have not satisfactorily analyzed, and including
words derivative rather than compound, I find in Hayden,
Morgan and Schoolcraft 262 different Iowa words. Of these
thirty-five as words represent words discussed in this paper;
thirty-nine others appear to be derived from roots herein discussed,
a number of them varying from the Dak. word only by
using a different suffix also herein compared. Out of 159 that
I have been able plainly to trace to Dakota words and roots 121
are to Dakotan roots and words which seem to be related to I
E forms. If I had sufficient Iowa material to enable me to find
Iowa roots independently, I doubt not the resemblance to the
Dakota would be much increased, and the resemblance to the
I E in a still greater degree.</p>

<p>The parable of the prodigal son as printed in Dr. Rigg's
dictionary, page 61, contains as there printed 417 words, 199
different<a name="FNanchor_K_12" id="FNanchor_K_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_12" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> words. Of these 36 words, occurring 186 times, are
in the exact form<a name="FNanchor_L_13" id="FNanchor_L_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_13" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> given in this paper; 8 other words, occurring
11 times, as given in my preceding paper; 75 other words,
occurring 106 times, are composed wholly of the words, roots
and pronominal elements compared with I E forms in the two
papers. There remain 114 words, 80 different words. If I
have correctly analyzed them they contain the following elements
compared in this paper: words and verb roots, 9 times,
pronouns 19 times, prepositional and pronominal prefixes 35
times. Much of the remainder, in all about nine-tenths of the
whole, seems to me represent I E materials with which I have
compared it. I do not doubt that some of the similarities will
prove in the end fallacious. On the other hand I have no doubt
that many new similarities will be found. My father made a list
of 1,243 Dakota verb stems, radical words and words which he
could not satisfactorily to himself derive from simpler elements.
Of these about 500 seem to be similar to I E forms with which
I have compared them, and from them are derived more than
three-fourths of the 16,000 words in Dr. Rigg's dictionary.</p>

<p>The pronouns, prepositions and suffixes herein given seem
to indicate that the Dakotas did not separate from the Teutonic
family till long after the latter separated from the South European
family. The fact that the Dak resembles the Icelandic
and Gothic in vocabulary and in structure much more than it
resembles the older Latin, points in the same direction. The
laws of consonantal change in many cases produce the same result
as Grimm's law, but the laws themselves are entirely different.
It <i>is certain</i>, therefore, that the Dakota has not been connected
with the Teutonic since the development of Grimm's law
made any considerable progress. I have studied the question
less, yet I think I have enough evidence in the system of consonantal
change <i>to prove</i> that the Dakota has not been connected
with the Slavonic or Lithuanian since they separated
from each other, or for some time previously. It is possible so
far as I can now say that the Dak may have borrowed material
from some language not I E, but I have found no evidence of it.
Undoubtedly the adoption of prisoners has introduced a considerable
percentage of Algonkin blood. It is also certain that they
have adopted some Chippewa religious observances, but even
in these they do not appear to have adopted any Chippewa
words.</p>
